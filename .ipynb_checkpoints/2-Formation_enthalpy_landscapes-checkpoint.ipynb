    "# Formation Energy Lanscape of Cubic Perovskites\n",

    "The formation energy ($\\Delta E_{f}^{Pm\\bar{3}m}$) of the perovskite structure is then calculated with respect to the energies of its constituent atoms as,\n",

    "    \\Delta E_f^{Pm\\bar{3}m}\\left(\\mbox{A}\\mbox{B}\\mbox{X}_{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{N}\\left[ E_{ABX_{3}}-E_{A}-E_{B}-3E_{X} \\right],\n",

    "Our primary interest here is the relative stabilities of the cubic perovskite phase, which is governed by its convex-hull stabilities ($\\Delta H_{c}$). However, this would require the knowledge of $\\Delta E_{f}$ for the most stable phase for every compound with ABX$_{3}$ stoichiometry. This information is not available for all materials to be screened here, which is particularly true for hypothetical materials. Although performing structure predictions across different crystallographic space groups can help providing a more accurate evaluation on the relative phase stabilities,  it would be computationally too demanding to follow this route for every new compound investigated in this work. As such, following the approach of *J. Phys. Chem. A* **123**, 7323 (2019), we proximate $\\Delta H_{c}$ as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\Delta H_c=\\Delta E_f^{Pm\\bar{3}m}-\\min\\left\\{\\Delta E_{f,i}^{\\mbox{rand}}, i\\in[1,10] \\right\\},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, starting from the optimized structure of a cubic perovskite, 10 random crystal structures are generated by arbitrarily distorting its lattice parameters and atomic positions. The randomly generated structure is  then fully optimized without any constraints. The lowest energy within these 10 random structures gives the second term in the above equation. As such, $\\Delta H_c$ effectively measures the convex hull stability of cubic perovskite with respect to a hypothetical $P1$ structure with the same composition. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook enable you to inspect the trend of $\\Delta H_c$ for all perovskites stored in this database. The values of $\\Delta H_c$ are plotted against the Goldschmidt tolerance factors for the cubic perovskites."
